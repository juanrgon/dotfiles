# live-tail
# This script runs a provided command and continuously displays the last 10 lines of its output.
# It stops running and clears the corresponding lines once the command finishes execution.
# The purpose is to have a clean terminal output for long-running commands that produce a lot of output.
# Note: This script uses ANSI escape codes to manipulate the cursor and the terminal screen,
# which might not work correctly in all terminal emulators.

# Usage: live-tail <command>
# Example: live-tail ping google.com

# check if command line arguments are provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No command provided. Usage: $0 <command>"
    exit 1
